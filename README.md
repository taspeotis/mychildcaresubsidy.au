A free calculator that estimates out-of-pocket child care costs for Australian families. It factors in the federal **Child Care Subsidy (CCS)** and state/territory funding programs so you can see what you'll actually pay.

## What's included

- **Federal CCS Calculator** — Estimate your Child Care Subsidy for centre-based day care, family day care, and outside school hours care (OSHC), including school-age children
- **ACT** — Free 3-Year-Old Preschool
- **NSW** — Start Strong fee relief
- **QLD** — Free Kindy
- **VIC** — Free Kinder

## How it works

1. **Child Care Subsidy** — The federal government subsidises your child care fees based on family income (up to 90%, or 95% for second and subsequent children)
2. **State/territory funding** — Your state or territory may provide additional funding for kindergarten or preschool programs
3. **Your gap fee** — You pay the remaining amount after both subsidies are applied

## Rates

Federal CCS rates are based on **FY2025-26** (July 2025 - June 2026). State and territory program rates are based on **calendar year 2025-26**.

This calculator provides estimates only and should not be taken as financial advice. Actual costs may vary.
